# Module1-Assessment4

This project is to showcase that I have learned how to use html tables & menus and apply the knowledge on a live project

## I've learned how to do the following:

### Menus
- create a navigation menu using the ```nav ``` tag 
- add an unordered list for the text that will be displayed on the menu using the ```ul``` tag
- add list items of the list using the ```li``` tag
- add an a tag that will enable the text inside of the unordered list menu to navigate to other parts of the page or to another page

### Body
-create a div element that will contain the main information of the page
-create a heading that will be displayed for the audience by using the ```h1``` tag

### Tables
- create a table by using the ```table``` element
-- this is the skeleton figure of the table
- create a row for the subheadings per column by using the ```tr``` tag
- create the data that will popuplate each column of the row above using the ```th``` tag
- create a row for the data that will be displayed under each subheading of the column by using the ```tr``` tag
-- each row data entry per column should be wrapped inside of the ```tr``` element
- then fill each column of the row with data using the ```td``` tag in chronological order which correspond with the subheadings of the table

### Style the table
